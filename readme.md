# Hello, world

## Prototype description

The working prototype will be an application that will allow California residents to establish and manage their profile and receive emergency and non-emergency notifications via email, Short Message Service (SMS), and/or push notification based on the location and contact information provided in their profile and/or the geo-location of their cellphone if they have opted in for this service. In addition, the working prototype will provide the authorized administrative users with the ability to publish notifications and track, and analyze and visualize related data. The working prototype does not need to implement any authentication or authorization against an external directory or authentication mechanism.

## Procurement requirements

a. Assigned one (1) leader and gave that person authority and responsibility and held that person accountable for the quality of the prototype submitted;

**The leader responsible for the quality of the prototype submitted is @danhon**.

b. Assembled a multidisciplinary and collaborative team that includes, at a minimum, five (5) of the labor categories as identified in Attachment B: PQVP DS-AD Labor Category Descriptions; 

**See the [multidisciplinary team](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/wiki/Multidisciplinary-team) page on the project wiki**.

c. Understood what people needed, by including people in the prototype development and design process; 

**See the [research journal](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/wiki/Research-journal) on the project wiki for evidence of how we are including people to understand what they need in making the prototype.**

d. Used at least a minimum of three (3) “user-centric design” techniques and/or tools;

**We are using the following "user-centric design" techniques and/or tools to make this prototype:**

	1. Questionnaires (quantitative feedback)
	2. In-person user testing (qualitative, hands-on usability testing)
	3. Remote user testing (qualitative, individuals providing feedback on experience)


e. Used GitHub to document code commits; 

**See the project [commit history](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/commits/master)**.

f. Used Swagger to document the RESTful API, and provided a link to the Swagger API;

g. Complied with Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act and WCAG 2.0;

h. Created or used a design style guide and/or a pattern library;

**This project will use the [Draft U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/) as style guide and/or pattern library**.

**See [Pull Request 13](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/pull/13) for the initial implementation of the pattern library.**

i. Performed usability tests with people;

j. Used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype;

k. Created a prototype that works on multiple devices, and presents a responsive design;

l. Used at least five (5) modern and open-source technologies, regardless of architectural layer (frontend, backend, etc.);

**We are using the following modern, open-source technologies for this prototype:**

	1.
	2.
	3.
	4.
	5.

m. Deployed the prototype on an Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) or Platform as Service (PaaS) provider, and indicated which provider they used;

**This project is using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) as PaaS provider, see the following [Issue](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/issues/3) for the inital setup of the Heroku deployment pipeline.**

**We are currently automatically deploying the master branch to [https://vlg-ctdadpq.herokuapp.com](https://vlg-ctdadpq.herokuapp.com).**

n. Developed automated unit tests for their code;

o. Setup or used a continuous integration system to automate the running of tests and continuously deployed their code to their IaaS or PaaS provider;

**We are using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) for continuous integration, automatically and continuously deploying the master branch to [https://vlg-ctdadpq.herokuapp.com](https://vlg-ctdadpq.herokuapp.com). See the following [Issue](https://github.com/VeryLittleGravitas/CDTADPQ/issues/3) for initial setup.**

p. Setup or used configuration management;

q. Setup or used continuous monitoring;

r. Deployed their software in an open source container, such as Docker (i.e., utilized operating-system-level virtualization);

s. Provided sufficient documentation to install and run their prototype on another machine; and

t. Prototype and underlying platforms used to create and run the prototype are openly licensed and free of charge.
